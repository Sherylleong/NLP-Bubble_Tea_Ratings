# NLP-Bubble_Tea_Ratings
Training a sequential network with NLP to predict ratings my friend would give based on his compiled reviews of different bubble teas.

When testing custom reviews, the review string "_the best milk tea i have ever had, tastes heavenly and worth every penny, highly recommended_" achieved a rating of 5.95/10, while the string  "_tastes bad, very bland, too expensive, not worth the money. do not buy_" achieved 5.92/10, so the effectiveness of the model is suspect. May need more advanced NLP labelling techniques or more training data.
